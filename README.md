# Walmart-Weekly-Sales-Analysis-
This project focuses on predicting Walmart store sales using historical data and external factors such as holidays and temperature.
I built it to strengthen my data-science foundations — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation — and to understand how forecasting helps retailers make better decisions.

Project Overview:

A. Retail data is noisy — stores behave differently based on promotions, weather, or events.
B. The goal here was to build a predictive model that can estimate future sales and highlight which factors drive performance.

Key steps:

1. Loaded and explored Walmart sales data

2. Cleaned missing values and handled outliers

3. Created time-based and store-level features

4. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns

5. Built and compared different regression models

6.Evaluated model performance and visualized results

Skills Demonstrated:

A. Data Wrangling: pandas, NumPy

B. Exploratory Analysis: matplotlib, seaborn

C. Feature Engineering: date extraction, holiday flags, scaling

D. Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

E. Model Evaluation: RMSE, R² score, residual analysis

Tech Stack:
Category:	    Tools
Language:	    Python 3
Libraries: 	  Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
Environment:	Google Colab 

Results in Short:

1. Achieved a strong baseline model that generalized well across stores

2. Found that holiday events and temperature were major drivers of weekly sales fluctuations

3. Visualized clear seasonal trends that could help optimize inventory planning

Personal Reflection:

This project helped me go beyond just running models — I learned how data understanding and feature logic matter more than the algorithm itself.
It also gave me a deeper appreciation of how data science directly supports business decisions in retail
